		<h3>One of the best of all time</h3>
		<p>A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case
			that
			it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.

			Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the
			time, it flies by.

			Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly
			fifty
			years old it puts many new films to shame.

			Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.

			If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is
			a
			difference.

			This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest,
			10/10.
